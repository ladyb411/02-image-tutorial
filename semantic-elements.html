    <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
    <h2>DC heroes</h2>
    <p>My first introduction to DC characters were Batman and Superman, but never was a huge fan of Superman and Batman was way cooler and had the best gadgets.</p>

    <h3>Marvel heroes or whatever</h3>
    <p>I prefer <em>Marvel</em> because they have done a better job with their characters through film and TV shows. <q>Also, they made them more fun, and it is <u>pure escapism for me</u>.</q> <strong>DC films have become to dark and moody</strong>.</p><br>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <blockquote> To summarize, I believe I am not familiar with all the DC comics to make an educated guess on the DC vs Marvel argument since my assessment is based on the television shows and films.</blockquote> 
    <p>I have definitely enjoyed the Marvel movies and the Superheroes they have brought to life.</p>
